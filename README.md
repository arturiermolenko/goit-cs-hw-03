## Setting Up the Environment
To set up the environment variables for the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a .env file
In the root of the project, you will find a file named .sample.env.
- Copy the .sample.env file and rename it to .env:

```bash
cp .sample.env .env
```

- Open the newly created .env file in a text editor.

- Modify the values of the environment variables to match your local configuration. Below is an example of the content in .sample.env:

```plaitext
task_1:
DB_NAME=task_management
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

task_2
MONGO_USER=your_mongo_username
MONGO_PASS=your_mongo_pass
APP_NAME=name_of_the_application
```
- Save the .env file. The values in this file will now be used by the application.

2. Environment Variables
Hereâ€™s a description of each environment variable in the .env file:

### task_1
DB_NAME: The name of your PostgreSQL database.\
DB_USER: The username used to connect to the database.\
DB_PASSWORD: The password for the database user.\
DB_HOST: The host where your database is located (usually localhost).\
DB_PORT: The port for connecting to the database (usually 5432 for PostgreSQL).

### task_2
MONGO_USER: Your username
MONGO_PASS: Your password
APP_NAME: Name of the application


3. Install Required Dependencies

You can install them with(go to the tasks folder to find requirements for needed project):

```bash
